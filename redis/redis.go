// Connect is a placeholder function.
// In a real client library, this might initialize a connection pool or a single connection.
// For a server implementation, this specific function might not be relevant in this package,
// as connection handling is typically done in the server's main loop (e.g., main.go).
// Keeping it for now as it was in the original file structure.
func Connect() {
	fmt.Println("Connected to Redis (placeholder function in redis package).")
}

// Functions ParseCommand and SerializeResponse have been moved to
// parser.go and serializer.go respectively.
// This file (redis.go) can serve as a package-level documentation point
// or for exporting key functionalities from the sub-files if we choose a facade pattern later.
// For now, ParseCommand and SerializeResponse are directly available from the redis package
// because they are defined in parser.go and serializer.go within the same 'redis' package.
